Renewed fears of a ‘tech bubble’ are growing among Wall Street analysts.

But APPL and MSFT remain modestly valued and growing rapidly, while the comparison to Germany’s stock market is inherently flawed.

Tech stocks are in a massive bubble, if you listen to many of the talking heads on Wall Street. And it’s easy to see how they came to this conclusion. Just look at the trillion-dollar valuations of Microsoft and Apple alone.

Welt’s Holger Zschaeapitz accurately pointed out that the combined market capitalization of Apple (APPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) alone is now larger than the entire German stock market.

“The market value of all listed German companies, at $2.18tn, is smaller than that of the 2 largest US corporations. Apple and Microsoft have a combined market capitalization of $2.233tn.”

At first glance, this seems like sure evidence of a bubble. Germany is no small fish; it’s the largest economy in Europe. How can two companies be worth more than the entire German stock market?

Of course, the story here is much more complicated than a simple chart…

Dot-com round two?

Rob Arnott, partner and CEO at Research Affiliates certainly lives in the “bubble” camp. Last month he said ‘FANMAG’ – an acronym referring to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Google – was wildly overvalued.

“Will these stocks produce such impressive growth that they will justify their current market cap, or are these implausible growth expectations? We do not have a crystal ball, of course, but we would recommend not betting on the momentum continuing.”

Reminder: analysts also called FAANG stocks a bubble in 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile Apple and Microsoft shares have almost tripled since 2015.

Apple and Microsoft: not overvalued

But let’s take Apple and Microsoft since they’re the specific stocks mentioned here. Their trillion-dollar valuations are lofty, but not without good reason.

Apple stock isn’t overvalued at all, based on the standard price/earnings ratio. As the Motley Fool wrote:

“Apple is still only valued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19. That’s nowhere near the 70-plus P/E ratio that Amazon trades at or the multiple of 30 that Facebook is currently trading around.”

There’s an argument to be made that some tech stocks, like Netflix, are overvalued, but Apple doesn’t seem to fall into that camp. Don’t forget that Apple has $94 billion cash in the vault, too.

What about Microsoft? MSFT stock is marginally overvalued compared to the historical stock market average (using price/earnings ratio). But it’s undervalued, based on MSFT’s historical average. Microsoft arguably enjoys a more generous P/E allowance by investors because it’s still growing rapidly. Company earnings continue to outperform, while its cloud computing arm, Azure, is growing revenue by 64% annually.

Based on these metrics, it’s hard to justify claims that Apple and Microsoft are overvalued.

German stock market is a poor comparison

Comparing Apple and Microsoft to the entire German stock market is a flawed comparison. Despite being the largest economy in Europe, Germany’s stock market is not an accurate representation of its output. As Deutsche Bank research put it:

“The German stock market has always been relatively small.”

Why? A variety of reasons from lack of investing culture and poor tax treatment to the large number of privately held companies.

“German retail investors tend to be cautious and risk-averse, which is reflected in their comparatively low equity holdings and the catchphrase “missing equity culture.”

Not only that but German pension funds barely touch the stock market while tax rules discourage risk-on investing. A further factor is that many German companies are family-owned.

“Numerous mid-sized German companies are (exclusively) family-owned, whereas they are often listed on the stock market elsewhere, particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries.”

The comparison to Apple and Microsoft makes for a compelling chart, but the reality means it’s not as scary as it sounds."
4,11/05/2019,msft,https://www.investopedia.com/microsoft-shares-are-surging-with-huge-demand-4775234,"A gain of 43.11% in 2019 for shares of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) likely couldn't have happened without big institutional buying. This buying is very unusual and has been happening very recently.

As the move to the cloud ramps up, Microsoft stands to be a major beneficiary. The latest government contract won by the company's cloud arm Azure has only increased demand for the stock. A great way to uncover tomorrow's winners is to look for great stocks seeing big buy activity, and Microsoft could be just the opportunity.

Smart money managers are always looking to bet on the next outlier stocks … the best in class. For Mapsignals, it's not enough to look at technicals and fundamentals alone. The key lies in the demand for shares … the big money.

I'll go into the fundamental picture later, but the true tell on the near-term trajectory of a stock lies in its trading activity. Simply put, it's all about supply and demand. When demand is higher than supply, the stock rises. When demand is lower than supply, stocks fall. For 2019, Microsoft stock has been a one-way train … higher.

For Mapsignals, when we look for an entry on a leading stock, we look for big money signals. Just to show you what our big money activity signals look like, have a look at all of the big money (unusual institutional) signals Microsoft stock has made over the past year. Focusing on 2019, you can see a lot of buy signals (green) beginning in March and through July. This same signal is currently flagging that big buying is rushing in:

www.mapsignals.com

In 2019, Microsoft has logged 16 big money buy signals, indicative of buying in the shares (see chart above). This shows that traders are likely thinking that the shares are poised to head higher. These data points suggest that big money appetite for the stock is high.

If you are going to make a bet on the direction of a stock, it is prudent to pay attention to how the shares are trading. Based on history, the odds suggest that Microsoft stock is poised for gains. The big money is always looking for an opportunity to buy shares in fast-growing companies. It's all about playing the odds by not fighting the trend.

Mapsignals' goal is to identify tomorrow's top stocks today. We're basically looking for outlier companies with healthy fundamentals accompanied by big money signals (outsized institutional activity). We are looking for the big money bets because big money moves stocks. By studying these data points, we can make an educated guess as to which stocks institutions are trafficking in and marry this information with fundamentally sound companies. We want the odds on our side when looking for the highest-quality stocks.

When we decide on a long candidate, we consider leaders that have a history of technical outperformance. When they show leadership, we see these as opportunities. The following are a few areas in which Microsoft stock has grabbed our attention year to date (YTD):

YTD outperformance vs. market: +18.90% vs. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

YTD outperformance vs. NASDAQ 100 ETF: +13.41% vs. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)

Recent big money buy signals

Now, we take it a step further and score the best stocks showing big money trading activity. Below, you can see that Microsoft has a big history of making buy signals for Mapsignals since 2018. The main takeaway is how the buy signals tend to last for a while when they get started. We think a new round of buy signals could be upon us soon:

www.mapsignals.com

On top of a long-term technical picture that is strong, one should also look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Microsoft's numbers are very strong:

Three-year revenue growth rate: +14.24%

Three-year earnings growth rate: +48.46%

Microsoft shares are breaking out as the market is at new highs. The company is quietly gaining with demand for its shares. We like the long-term story of the stock. The narrative for Microsoft and other high-quality software/cloud stocks is one of a growth cycle in the years ahead.

We are always on the lookout for great companies pressing higher year after year. The best companies in a group tend to outperform over the long run. Software stocks have been one of the strongest groups in recent years. All of this points to a long-term opportunity for the stock.

The Bottom Line

Microsoft stock is breaking out with buying pressure. Our big money indicator is signaling that we should take notice. Shares could be positioned for more upside. Given the historical growth in share price and growing fundamentals, this stock could be worth a spot in a growth-oriented portfolio.

6,11/05/2019,msft,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/02/is-microsoft-a-buy.aspx,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been one of the top names in tech for decades, and with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion, it's one of the most highly valued companies today. Even amid rising competition from some big names in the industry like Apple and Amazon.com, the company has been able to not only keep growing its sales but to significantly expand its profits along the way as well.

Up 200% over the past five years, Microsoft has remained a strong investment. But let's take a closer look at where it is today and whether it's still, at a rather high earnings multiple, a good buy or not.

Another impressive earnings beat

Microsoft recently released its fiscal first-quarter earnings for 2020, and yet again, the stock surpassed expectations with earnings per share of $1.38 and revenues of $33.06 billion. However, beating expectations has been the norm for Microsoft, and that's why a strong performance is usually not enough for the stock to get a big boost.

The one negative for the company that likely kept its stock from soaring was that its guidance for Q2 was a little underwhelming. Microsoft is projecting revenue to come in as high as $35.95 billion next quarter, which is shy of the $36.02 billion that analysts are anticipating, but that amounts to a variance of less than 1%. Unfortunately, any blemish could be enough to keep the stock from gaining traction.

Diversification and recurring revenue are the company's greatest strengths

A growing trend we've seen in the world of tech is a move toward software as a service (SaaS), in which companies generate recurring revenue and simply push out their latest product updates via the cloud. Microsoft is a great example of how to do that well with the success of its Office 365 subscription service, which now has more than 200 million commercial monthly active users. Office is a staple at many companies, and without a viable competitor, it ensures that Microsoft will be able to continue enjoying stable, recurring revenue even without having to make significant changes to its existing software.

However, whether it's Office, gaming, or other recurring services, what makes Microsoft strong is its wide variety of revenue streams. The one exhibiting the strongest growth, Azure, the company's cloud computing platform, generated year-over-year sales growth of 59% this past quarter. While that's impressive, it's lower than the 64% expansion it generated in fiscal Q4 2019 and down from Q1 of last year when it sported a growth rate of 76%.

Although the slowing growth rates may be cause for concern, the reality is that Microsoft will likely continue finding new avenues for growth. It did just that recently when it secured a contract worth $10 billion from the Department of Defense for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) Cloud contract. The 10-year deal is an important one that will involve modernizing the Pentagon's technology, which will inject Microsoft with even more sales.

Is Microsoft's valuation too rich?

There's no denying Microsoft is a solid company, and there are still a lot of ways the company can grow simply by monetizing more of its services and expanding existing ones. The big question, especially for value-oriented investors, is whether the stock is simply too expensive.

In total, revenue rose just 14% year over year this past quarter, and for a stock that trades at 26 times its earnings, an argument could be made that it is a bit rich for that level of growth. A price-to-book multiple of 10 also suggests that investors are paying a bit of a premium for the stock today.

Microsoft is currently trading near its 52-week high, and it's definitely a bit on the expensive side. However, if you're going to pay a premium for a stock, it may as well be one like Microsoft that has a strong brand behind it, offers lots of great products and services, and incurs relatively lower risk versus other tech stocks. And with a dividend yield of around 1.5%, investors have a bit of an extra incentive for owning the stock.

While you won't be getting a bargain by buying shares of Microsoft today, it is a quality, long-term investment that can generate some solid returns for you over the years."

8,11/05/2019,msft,https://www.investopedia.com/why-microsoft-will-have-to-race-to-catch-up-to-amazon-in-cloud-sales-4774477,"Despite beating Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) for a new 10-year, $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will have to race to catch up to its larger rivals. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads in the still booming cloud computing market, with a market share triple that of Microsoft’s Azure platform. Now, however, Azure’s Chief Technology Officer is confident that Microsoft will overtake the e-commerce giant in the cloud war, as outlined by Barron’s.

Cloud Market Dynamics

While Microsoft's cloud sales grew 59% in the latest quarter, versus a 35% rate for Amazon Web Services over the same period, Amazon remains No. 1 in public cloud computing services with a whopping 47.8% market share last year, followed by Microsoft at 15.5%, and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) at 7.7%. Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM) trail behind in fourth and fifth place, with a respective 4% and 1.8% share of the global cloud market.

Following Microsoft’s win of the Defense Department’s contract, analysts are now more optimistic that the old guard tech company can land other bigger deals with enterprises and the government.

CTO Mark Russinovich spoke to Barron’s about Microsoft’s competitive positioning in the cloud market, a space where business can still thrive even if a downturn does hit the market. This strength can be attributed to a massive shift away from on-premise data centers to the cloud, which offers more competitive pricing, better reliability, and an easier path to scale up.

What’s Next?

Russinovich says Azure stands out from its rivals due to its hybrid cloud offering. “If we’re talking to enterprise customers, I would say it’s our understanding and relationship with the enterprise, as evidenced by the understanding that they’re going to be hybrid. So building services that meet the requirements for migrating workloads into the cloud,” he said.

Azure’s growth has propelled Microsoft’s stock to jump 42% in 2019, versus a 21% return for the S&P 500 in 2019."
9,11/05/2019,msft,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/01/microsoft-stock-buy-at-the-high.aspx,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been on a tear so far in 2019. The tech colossus' stock price is already up more than 40% this year, and its shares are trading near all-time highs. But could this $1 trillion behemoth still be undervalued?

Cloud-based growth

Microsoft's transition to the cloud has been impressive. Its decision to offer its Office suite of productivity applications as a cloud-based service was brilliant. Rather than receiving a one-time up-front sale and then trying to convince users to upgrade several years later, as was historically the case with the traditional packaged software model, Microsoft's Office 365 service helps to lock users into its ecosystem with a relatively small, but recurring, monthly fee . Microsoft is able to deliver upgrades via the cloud, which helps to keep its software up to date and users on the same and best version of its software. This provides a better experience to users and gives Microsoft a consistent source of high-margin, recurring revenue.

Microsoft has also built a powerful cloud infrastructure business. Microsoft Azure gives businesses access to top-tier cloud computing resources. Instead of spending huge sums to build their own data centers, these companies rent Microsoft's cloud computing assets on an as-needed basis. In turn, they enjoy cost savings and increased operational flexibility.

Cloud computing has grown into a massive industry, one that's projected to exceed $623 billion by 2023, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets, up from $272 billion in 2018. Microsoft is currently the No. 2 player in this enormous market, behind Amazon Web Services, and it's quickly gaining share on its rival. Microsoft recently won a $10 billion contract from the Defense Department, edging out Amazon in the process.

In its fiscal 2020 first quarter, Microsoft's productivity and business processes revenue rose 13% year over year to $11.1 billion, driven by a 25% jump in Office 365 commercial sales. Meanwhile, revenue in its Intelligent Cloud business leapt 27% to $10.8 billion, fueled by a 59% surge in Azure sales.

Bountiful capital returns

Better still, Microsoft excels at turning sales of its software services into cash for investors. The company recently boosted its quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.51 per share. On an annualized basis, Microsoft's $2.04 payout currently represents a yield of about 1.4%.

The tech titan is also buying back its shares in droves. Microsoft repurchased nearly $20 billion worth of its stock in fiscal 2019, and its board of directors approved a new $40 billion share repurchase program in September.

In all, Microsoft returned more than $33 billion to investors in 2019, including nearly $14 billion in dividends. Incredibly, the tech powerhouse's free cash flow exceeded these huge capital returns by approximately $5 billion during this time. Microsoft also has more than $60 billion in net cash in its coffers. This fortress-like financial position -- along with the strong likelihood that its cloud businesses will continue to drive its cash flow production even higher -- makes it a safe bet for investors to expect many more dividend increases in the coming years.

So, is Microsoft a buy?

Some investors may balk at paying 27 times Microsoft's projected earnings for fiscal 2020, but I'd argue it's a fair price to pay for an elite enterprise that should be able to grow its earnings by more than 15% annually over the next half-decade.

Thus, I believe that Microsoft's stock is a buy -- and that investors who buy shares today are likely to enjoy solid gains from this point forward."

Although the slowing growth rates may be cause for concern, the reality is that Microsoft will likely continue finding new avenues for growth. It did just that recently when it secured a contract worth $10 billion from the Department of Defense for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) Cloud contract. The 10-year deal is an important one that will involve modernizing the Pentagon's technology, which will inject Microsoft with even more sales.

Is Microsoft's valuation too rich?

There's no denying Microsoft is a solid company, and there are still a lot of ways the company can grow simply by monetizing more of its services and expanding existing ones. The big question, especially for value-oriented investors, is whether the stock is simply too expensive.

In total, revenue rose just 14% year over year this past quarter, and for a stock that trades at 26 times its earnings, an argument could be made that it is a bit rich for that level of growth. A price-to-book multiple of 10 also suggests that investors are paying a bit of a premium for the stock today.

Microsoft is currently trading near its 52-week high, and it's definitely a bit on the expensive side. However, if you're going to pay a premium for a stock, it may as well be one like Microsoft that has a strong brand behind it, offers lots of great products and services, and incurs relatively lower risk versus other tech stocks. And with a dividend yield of around 1.5%, investors have a bit of an extra incentive for owning the stock.

While you won't be getting a bargain by buying shares of Microsoft today, it is a quality, long-term investment that can generate some solid returns for you over the years."

(AMZN) for a new 10-year, $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will have to race to catch up to its larger rivals. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads in the still booming cloud computing market, with a market share triple that of Microsoft’s Azure platform. Now, however, Azure’s Chief Technology Officer is confident that Microsoft will overtake the e-commerce giant in the cloud war, as outlined by Barron’s.

Cloud Market Dynamics

While Microsoft's cloud sales grew 59% in the latest quarter, versus a 35% rate for Amazon Web Services over the same period, Amazon remains No. 1 in public cloud computing services with a whopping 47.8% market share last year, followed by Microsoft at 15.5%, and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) at 7.7%. Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM) trail behind in fourth and fifth place, with a respective 4% and 1.8% share of the global cloud market.

Following Microsoft’s win of the Defense Department’s contract, analysts are now more optimistic that the old guard tech company can land other bigger deals with enterprises and the government.

CTO Mark Russinovich spoke to Barron’s about Microsoft’s competitive positioning in the cloud market, a space where business can still thrive even if a downturn does hit the market. This strength can be attributed to a massive shift away from on-premise data centers to the cloud, which offers more competitive pricing, better reliability, and an easier path to scale up.

What’s Next?

Russinovich says Azure stands out from its rivals due to its hybrid cloud offering. “If we’re talking to enterprise customers, I would say it’s our understanding and relationship with the enterprise, as evidenced by the understanding that they’re going to be hybrid. So building services that meet the requirements for migrating workloads into the cloud,” he said.

Azure’s growth has propelled Microsoft’s stock to jump 42% in 2019, versus a 21% return for the S&P 500 in 2019."
19,11/05/2019,msft,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/01/microsoft-stock-buy-at-the-high.aspx,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been on a tear so far in 2019. The tech colossus' stock price is already up more than 40% this year, and its shares are trading near all-time highs. But could this $1 trillion behemoth still be undervalued?

Cloud-based growth

Microsoft's transition to the cloud has been impressive. Its decision to offer its Office suite of productivity applications as a cloud-based service was brilliant. Rather than receiving a one-time up-front sale and then trying to convince users to upgrade several years later, as was historically the case with the traditional packaged software model, Microsoft's Office 365 service helps to lock users into its ecosystem with a relatively small, but recurring, monthly fee . Microsoft is able to deliver upgrades via the cloud, which helps to keep its software up to date and users on the same and best version of its software. This provides a better experience to users and gives Microsoft a consistent source of high-margin, recurring revenue.

Microsoft has also built a powerful cloud infrastructure business. Microsoft Azure gives businesses access to top-tier cloud computing resources. Instead of spending huge sums to build their own data centers, these companies rent Microsoft's cloud computing assets on an as-needed basis. In turn, they enjoy cost savings and increased operational flexibility.

Cloud computing has grown into a massive industry, one that's projected to exceed $623 billion by 2023, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets, up from $272 billion in 2018. Microsoft is currently the No. 2 player in this enormous market, behind Amazon Web Services, and it's quickly gaining share on its rival. Microsoft recently won a $10 billion contract from the Defense Department, edging out Amazon in the process.

In its fiscal 2020 first quarter, Microsoft's productivity and business processes revenue rose 13% year over year to $11.1 billion, driven by a 25% jump in Office 365 commercial sales. Meanwhile, revenue in its Intelligent Cloud business leapt 27% to $10.8 billion, fueled by a 59% surge in Azure sales.

Bountiful capital returns

Better still, Microsoft excels at turning sales of its software services into cash for investors. The company recently boosted its quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.51 per share. On an annualized basis, Microsoft's $2.04 payout currently represents a yield of about 1.4%.

The tech titan is also buying back its shares in droves. Microsoft repurchased nearly $20 billion worth of its stock in fiscal 2019, and its board of directors approved a new $40 billion share repurchase program in September.

In all, Microsoft returned more than $33 billion to investors in 2019, including nearly $14 billion in dividends. Incredibly, the tech powerhouse's free cash flow exceeded these huge capital returns by approximately $5 billion during this time. Microsoft also has more than $60 billion in net cash in its coffers. This fortress-like financial position -- along with the strong likelihood that its cloud businesses will continue to drive its cash flow production even higher -- makes it a safe bet for investors to expect many more dividend increases in the coming years.

So, is Microsoft a buy?

Some investors may balk at paying 27 times Microsoft's projected earnings for fiscal 2020, but I'd argue it's a fair price to pay for an elite enterprise that should be able to grow its earnings by more than 15% annually over the next half-decade.

Thus, I believe that Microsoft's stock is a buy -- and that investors who buy shares today are likely to enjoy solid gains from this point forward."
