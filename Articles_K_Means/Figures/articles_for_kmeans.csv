0,11/05/2019,ge,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/general-electric-earnings-q3-2019.html,"General Electric's stock surged Wednesday after the industrial conglomerate raised its 2019 cash flow forecast and reported adjusted third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations. On a nonadjusted basis, and including certain accounting charges, GE still lost $9.5 billion in the quarter.

GE shares jumped 11.5% on heavy trading volume to close at $10.11 a share, its second best day of trading this year.

Here's what the company reported versus what Wall Street expected:

EPS: adjusted 15 cents a share, vs. 11 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

Revenue: $23.36 billion, vs. $22.93 billion expected in the Refinitiv survey.

""Our results reflect another quarter of progress in the transformation of GE,"" Chairman and CEO Larry Culp said in a statement.

GE said its closely watched industrial free cash flow, which is used as a gauge of efficiency, totaled $650 million. FCF is money left over after a company pays for operating expenses and capital spending. The company increased its 2019 forecast for industrial FCF to a range of flat to $2 billion, up from a range between negative and plus $1 billion.

""We are raising our industrial free cash flow outlook again even with external headwinds from the 737 Max and tariffs,"" Culp said."

3,11/05/2019,ge,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ges-stock-rockets-after-another-earnings-beat-and-more-optimistic-outlook-2019-10-30,"Shares of General Electric Co. powered higher in very active trading Wednesday, as the industrial conglomerate reported progress on its turnaround plan with another earnings beat, and after Chief Executive Larry Culp set an upbeat tone on the conference call with analysts.

Culp, who now has now a full year under his belt as GE’s leader, still referred to 2019 as a “reset year,” and said it was still “early” in a multi-year transformation. However, he told analysts in the post-earnings call that he keeps seeing signs of stabilization in the troubled power business, and that he was “more optimistic” than when he started that “considerable value” can be unlocked for shareholders.

“And I’m confident that in 2020, and in 2021, we’ll see meaningfully better performance for GE as a whole,” Culp said, according to a FactSet transcript.

Don’t miss: Some expected GE CEO Larry Culp to break up the company. Instead, he’s trying to fix it.

The stock GE, +4.38% soared 11.5% to $10.11, the highest close since July 31. Trading volume ballooned to 215.9 million shares, enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges, and nearly five times the full-day average of about 44.4 million shares.

The stock has now run up 39% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.06% has advanced 17%.

The company also raised its 2019 industrial free cash flow (FCF) guidance again, to a range of zero to $2 billion, from negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion as of July and from negative $2 billion to zero as of March. GE said it expects FCF to be in “positive territory” in 2020, with further acceleration in 2021.

For the latest quarter, industrial FCF was $650 million, down from $1.14 billion. Analyst Andrew Obin at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said FCF was “surprisingly strong” as he was expecting “flat.” He reiterated his neutral rating, saying he views the underlying drivers of FCF as “relatively low quality” and with “limited disclosure.’

GE reported earlier a third-quarter net loss of $9.47 billion, or $1.08 a share, after a loss of $22.81 billion, or $2.64 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as an $8.7 billion charge from ceding majority ownership of Baker Hughes and other insurance-related and goodwill charges, adjusted earnings per share rose to 15 cents from 11 cents, to beat the FactSet consensus of 12 cents.

That marks the third-straight quarter that GE beat adjusted profit expectations.

Total revenue increased 1% to $23.48 billion, with a 14% drop in revenue in its power business was offset by a 13 increase in renewable energy, 8% growth in aviation and a 5% rise in healthcare. Read more about GE’s business segment performance.

Within the power division, orders fell 30%, while the 14% revenue decline came as gas power revenue rose 2% and power portfolio revenue slumped 37%, largely driven by weakness in the steam business.

The revenue decline was an improvement from the 25% drop in the sequential second quarter and a 22% decline in the first quarter. It was the smallest revenue decline for power since the 9% fall in the first quarter of 2018.

The revenue growth came with a 2.9% decrease in the cost of sales to $17.33 billion. Outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on the call that part of the decline in gross corporate costs came with job cuts, which reached about 7,000 so far this year.

For the rest of the year, CEO Culp said the “watch items” are the same, including an uncertain global economy, trade and tariffs, the continued grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 MAX planes for which GE makes the engines, and the low interest rate environment.

“So in summary, the hard work continues,” Culp said. “And from the inside, I’m seeing the improvements I wanted to see when we started on this path a year ago, improvements that will yield long-term results for all of GE’s stakeholders.”

Perhaps next quarter, Culp can stop using the “reset” word to describe the company’s progress."
4,11/05/2019,ge,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/31/ge-stock-soars-11-as-the-turnaround-gains-momentum.aspx,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock has experienced extreme volatility over the past year, as investors have struggled to understand the company's chances of turning itself around. On one hand, new CEO Larry Culp has provided a steady hand and motivated his subordinates to deliver better execution. On the other hand, many parts of GE's power and renewables segments are struggling, the company continues to carry a heavy debt load, and some investors are worried about the potential for significant additional losses at GE Capital.

In recent months, the bears have been winning the debate, as GE stock has slipped far below its 52-week high of around $11. However, General Electric made solid progress on its turnaround last quarter. This caused the stock to jump 11% on Wednesday, surpassing the $10 mark for the first time in nearly three months. Even after this big gain, GE stock has plenty of upside, as long as the company doesn't face any major setbacks in 2020.

GE reports solid Q3 results and boosts cash flow guidance

As usual, there were a lot of moving parts in General Electric's earnings report last quarter, because the company is in the midst of a major restructuring. Revenue was roughly flat year over year at $23.4 billion. Revenue for the company's industrial businesses rose 7% on an organic basis, though. Meanwhile, GE posted a loss from continuing operations of $0.15 per share but an adjusted profit of $0.15 per share. That beat the average analyst estimate of $0.11.

The $0.30 difference between earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted EPS was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge, an insurance charge related to lower interest rates, and other smaller one-time items.

GE's adjusted industrial operating margin improved to 10% from 8.5% a year earlier, because of big charges recorded by the struggling power segment in Q3 2018. (GE Power reduced its operating loss by 79% year over year.) The highly profitable aviation and health segments also posted modest earnings growth last quarter, but the renewables business swung to a small loss from a small profit in the prior-year period.

For the full year, General Electric is maintaining its guidance for adjusted EPS to come in between $0.55 and $0.65, despite a $0.05 headwind from giving up its majority stake in Baker Hughes in September. In addition, for the second straight quarter, GE raised its full-year free cash flow guidance by $1 billion. It now expects to produce $0 to $2 billion of industrial free cash flow in 2019.

Another eventful quarter

There was a lot of news at GE last quarter. In August, serial whistleblower Harry Markopolos accused it of accounting fraud, particularly with respect to its insurance business. GE stock plunged by 11% immediately following the accusations, but experts quickly dismissed Markopolos' analysis. Indeed, on Wednesday, GE reported that the company's annual test of its insurance reserves found that the new actuarial assumptions it adopted two years ago remain valid. While the company took a $1 billion pre-tax charge related to its insurance business, that was driven by changes to the discount rate used to estimate future investment returns.

GE also continued to address its weak balance sheet during the third quarter. Most notably, it sold the rest of its shares in Wabtec and sold another substantial portion of its stake in Baker Hughes. This enabled it to reduce its gross borrowings to $93.2 billion as of the end of last quarter, down from $105.8 billion a quarter earlier.

Finally, General Electric announced several changes to its pension and other retirement programs in early October. Most notably, it will freeze the pension benefits of 20,000 current salaried employees at the end of 2020. Those employees will keep the benefits they have already earned but will receive 401(k) plan contributions rather than accruing additional pension benefits in the future. This move and several other adjustments will largely offset the impact of this year's decline in interest rates, which would have caused GE's pension deficit to spike higher.

Plenty of room for improvement

General Electric has made a lot of progress in fixing its problems over the past year. It has also lined up several major asset sales, which will enable it to significantly reduce its debt again in 2020, reducing the inherent risk of GE stock.

Nevertheless, Culp and his leadership team recognize that the company still has a lot of work ahead of it. While Culp expects results to improve next year, GE will still be working through restructuring costs and various legacy issues. It will take until at least 2021 for GE to really hit its stride.

However, if GE can get its weaker business units back to sustainable profitability by then (or soon thereafter), it would be great news for shareholders. The company's largest and most profitable business, GE Aviation, has ample room for revenue and profit growth in the years ahead, driven by a growing military business and rising services revenue from its expanding installed base of commercial jet engines. Without the rest of the company holding it back, the aviation segment's strong growth should drive big gains for GE stock."

General Electric increased industrial product and service sales 1 percent in the third quarter, but overall revenue was pulled down by its GE Capital division in Norwalk which the conglomerate continues to shrink one year into the tenure of CEO Larry Culp Jr.

GE recorded a $9.5 billion loss for the quarter, most of it to account for GE ceding ownership of the oil field services company Baker Hughes which GE acquired in 2017 a year after former CEO Jeff Immelt moved GE’s headquarters to Boston from Fairfield.

GE also took an $800 million charge against earnings for a former insurance unit that remains on the hook for claims on policies from years ago.

On a Wednesday conference call, Culp to investment analysts that GE has been able to contain some expected severance costs for job terminations as employees have left on their own accord.

Revenue totaled $23.36 billion in the third quarter, down $32 million from a year ago, with orders on which GE expects to record fuure revenue off 5 percent to $22.5 billion. GE’s total backlog of orders remains up 14 percent from a year ago, however, to $368 billion. Shares of GE crested the $10 mark Wednesday morning before tailing off slightly in the afternoon, up nearly 10 percent from the closing price Tuesday.

GE told investors on Wednesday that China tariffs are having an ongoing impact on profits, particularly for divisions selling medical equipment and renewable energy systems. And the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets continues to affect GE Aviation results, with the company part of a joint venture supplying engines for the aircraft and currently expecting a $1.4 billion impact to GE Aviation.

“Obviously, we didn’t come into this year expecting what has played out in that regard,” Culp said Wednesday. “Again, our primary focus is to support Boeing and our carrier customers with respect to what they return to service.”

Culp is continuing Immelt’s plan to reduce GE Capital to providing financing to support the parent company’s industrial units, versus the broad array of commercial and consumer financial services GE Capital oversaw formerly. The company shed GE Capital assets totaling roughly $2 billion during the quarter to leave it with $121 billion in assets entering October, with GE Capital revenue down 15 percent in the third quarter to $2.1 billion.

GE Capital took a $663 million loss in the third quarter after recording a small profit in the same period a year ago, with GE running an annual “premium deficiency” test on insurance reserves it keeps on the books in accordance with U.S. accounting rules.

GE Capital’s losses for the first nine months of the year are $344 million, an improvement from the $2 billion in red ink it produced in the first three quarters of 2018.

General Electric Co.’s path to recovery is a long one, but the company no longer seems lost in the woods.

In releasing its third-quarter results on Wednesday, GE also raised its guidance for 2019 free cash flow and now anticipates its industrial businesses could bring in as much as $2 billion this year. That’s a $4 billion swing from GE’s worst-case scenario in its initial March forecast. There’s a fine line between setting a low bar and sandbagging the numbers, but GE’s rosier outlook is supported by signs of stabilization in its beleaguered power unit and there being less of a drag than anticipated from the transition of a supply-chain financing program to a third party. The aviation business was also able to largely offset the negative impact of the continued grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max. Those were key worry points that ended up not being as worrisome.

It wasn’t a perfect quarter and there are some notable footnotes to that guidance increase. Still, a lack of nasty surprises and minimal signs to date of macroeconomic weakness in GE’s aviation and health-care businesses make this a victory for CEO Larry Culp. A flurry of deleveraging activities in the last two months had raised concerns that GE was trying to give itself some good news to talk about if the actual quarterly numbers were disappointments, particularly amid growing concerns that a manufacturing slowdown was deepening. That fear appears unfounded, at least as far as the last three months are concerned for GE’s businesses.

Staging a Recovery GE shares had slumped since its last earnings update amid concerns about interest rates and accusations from a short-seller-backed whistle-blower Source: Bloomberg

Shares of GE rallied as much as 14% on the report, essentially erasing a slide since its last earnings update in July that in part reflected concerns over the impact of slumping interest rates. The decline in rates forced GE to reassess its expectations for the returns it will get on assets supporting the company’s long-term-care insurance business. While this contributed to a $1 billion pre-tax charge in the latest quarter as the company bolstered its GAAP reserves, it’s better than the “ somewhere south” of $1.5 billion adjustment – before other offsets – that Culp had flagged in September. And it’s certainly nowhere in the ballpark of what’s implied in the $29 billion reserve shortfall Bernie Madoff whistle-blower Harry Markopolos claimed existed.

Operating profit for the power segment turned negative again after a few quarters of positive numbers. But margins did improve in that business – to negative 3.7% from negative 14.8% a year earlier – which GE says reflects better pricing discipline. The company now expects the cash burn at the power unit to be no worse than the $2.3 billion outflow last year (adjusted for a reorganization of that business), versus an initial prediction of a substantial year-over-year weakening. The health-care division saw a nice lift in profit margins and a 5% jump in sales, even as its imaging business struggled in China and some larger U.S> projects got pushed out. And aviation rebounded from an uncharacteristically weak second quarter. These are all positive data points that speak to Culp’s push for operational improvements.

What hasn’t changed is that even at $2 billion, GE’s free cash flow will be very weak this year. The current forecast compares to $4.5 billion last year and $5.6 billion in 2017. While a stronger starting point in 2019 certainly helps, GE will have to overcome a number of challenges to get back to even those depressed levels.

Still Resetting GE's free cash flow is likely to remain at historically depressed levels over the next few years Source: Bloomberg

Already, GE will lose about $1 billion in free cash flow in 2020 from the sale of its biopharmaceutical business to Danaher Corp., per analysts’ estimates. Despite an improved performance in 2019, there’s no update at this time for GE’s expectation for the power unit to continue burning cash next year. And GE has to keep spending on restructuring. It again lowered its estimate for the cost of these cutbacks this year (which was a boon to its free-cash-flow outlook) in part because of the “timing” of politically fraught conversations in Europe over facilities and employees absorbed as part of its disastrous acquisition of Alstom SA’s power business. Keeping economic headwinds at bay will also be key.

Meanwhile, GE will get lower contributions from Baker Hughes as it continues to wind down its stake; a divestiture in September pushed that holding below 50%, forcing the company to take an $8.7 billion pre-tax charge in the quarter.

Culp is doing what he needs to do to stop the bleeding at GE. Now the conversation shifts to what kind of company this is going to look like when he’s done and how far this turnaround can go.

Clariscan is a gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial), spine and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.

Clariscan has been approved in more than 55 countries globally and has had more than four million patient doses shipped in those countries. It is the latest in a growing range of imaging agents available in the U.S. from GE Healthcare. For more than 40 years, GE agents have been routinely used across MRI, X-ray/CT and ultrasound to enhance the image and support diagnosis.

“ Demand for contrast media has significantly increased over the past decade. The introduction of Clariscan increases our clinical offering for U.S. radiologists, enhancing visualization to provide better patient care. Our customers rely on our high-quality products, first-rate supply network, and surrounding services to support their day-to-day work,” explained Kevin O’Neill, President & CEO Pharmaceutical Diagnostics at GE Healthcare.

“ The FDA’s approval of this macrocyclic MR agent adds to the range of contrast media options available here in the U.S. and as radiologists we welcome this broader choice,” said Dr. Lawrence N Tanenbaum, M.D., FACR.

GE Healthcare offers diagnostic imaging agents used in approximately 90 million procedures per year globally, equivalent to three patients every second. In the U.S., GE Healthcare has a strong record of innovation in new contrast media products and indications, with recent FDA approvals for Omnipaque™ (iohexol) in CT of the abdomen and for Visipaque™ (iodixanol) in coronary CT angiography. GE Healthcare has invested $240 million in its global manufacturing and supply network over the past five years to deliver imaging agents to hospitals and pharmacies globally.

Clariscan is manufactured in Norway using a proprietary manufacturing process. As with all GE Healthcare contrast media products, all stages of manufacturing, from development of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to finished product, are managed entirely by GE Healthcare. Clariscan is available in single dose vials of 10, 15 and 20 mL. The packaging contains a 2D data matrix (barcode) on every Clariscan pack, which conveys key information, including national drug code number, individual lot number, and expiration date. This information can be easily scanned and uploaded onto electronic medical systems, helping to reduce the risk of manual data entry errors and helping workflow efficiencies at medical centers.

CLARISCANTM (gadoterate meglumine) injection for intravenous use

PRODUCT INDICATIONS AND USE:

CLARISCAN™ (gadoterate meglumine) is a gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial), spine, and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.

Additional pediatric use information is approved for Guerbet LLC’s Dotarem (gadoterate meglumine injection). However, due to Guerbet LLC’s marketing exclusivity, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT CLARISCANTM

WARNING: NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS (NSF)

See full Prescribing Information for complete Boxed Warning. Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with: Chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), or Acute kidney injury.

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g. age > 60 years, hypertension, diabetes), estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.

For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Clariscan dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to any re-administration.

Contraindications

History of clinically important hypersensitivity reactions to Clariscan.

Warnings and precautions

Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with Clariscan, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of Clariscan administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before Clariscan administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Clariscan. Administer Clariscan only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation.

Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with Clariscan, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of Clariscan administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Gadolinium retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. The highest concentrations have been identified in the bone, followed by brain, skin, kidney, liver and spleen. The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention.

The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Acute kidney injury : In patients with chronically reduced renal function, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging.

: In patients with chronically reduced renal function, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging. Extravasation and injection site reactions: Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of Clariscan. Extravasation into tissues during Clariscan administration may result in tissue irritation.

Adverse reactions

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 0.2%) associated with Clariscan in clinical trials were nausea, headache, injection site pain, injection site coldness and rash.

Serious adverse reactions in the postmarketing experience have been reported with Clariscan. These serious adverse reactions include but are not limited to: arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, pharyngeal edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, coma and convulsion.

Use in specific populations

Pregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. The human data on the association between GBCAs and adverse fetal outcomes are limited and inconclusive. Because of the potential risks of gadolinium to the fetus, use Clariscan only if imaging is essential during pregnancy and cannot be delayed. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal exposure to GBCAs.

10,11/05/2019,ge,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/general-electric-earnings-q3-2019.html,"General Electric's stock surged Wednesday after the industrial conglomerate raised its 2019 cash flow forecast and reported adjusted third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations. On a nonadjusted basis, and including certain accounting charges, GE still lost $9.5 billion in the quarter.

GE shares jumped 11.5% on heavy trading volume to close at $10.11 a share, its second best day of trading this year.

Here's what the company reported versus what Wall Street expected:

GE said its closely watched industrial free cash flow, which is used as a gauge of efficiency, totaled $650 million. FCF is money left over after a company pays for operating expenses and capital spending. The company increased its 2019 forecast for industrial FCF to a range of flat to $2 billion, up from a range between negative and plus $1 billion.

13,11/05/2019,ge,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ges-stock-rockets-after-another-earnings-beat-and-more-optimistic-outlook-2019-10-30,"Shares of General Electric Co. powered higher in very active trading Wednesday, as the industrial conglomerate reported progress on its turnaround plan with another earnings beat, and after Chief Executive Larry Culp set an upbeat tone on the conference call with analysts.

Culp, who now has now a full year under his belt as GE’s leader, still referred to 2019 as a “reset year,” and said it was still “early” in a multi-year transformation. However, he told analysts in the post-earnings call that he keeps seeing signs of stabilization in the troubled power business, and that he was “more optimistic” than when he started that “considerable value” can be unlocked for shareholders.

“And I’m confident that in 2020, and in 2021, we’ll see meaningfully better performance for GE as a whole,” Culp said, according to a FactSet transcript.

Don’t miss: Some expected GE CEO Larry Culp to break up the company. Instead, he’s trying to fix it.

The stock GE, +4.38% soared 11.5% to $10.11, the highest close since July 31. Trading volume ballooned to 215.9 million shares, enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges, and nearly five times the full-day average of about 44.4 million shares.

The stock has now run up 39% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.06% has advanced 17%.

The company also raised its 2019 industrial free cash flow (FCF) guidance again, to a range of zero to $2 billion, from negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion as of July and from negative $2 billion to zero as of March. GE said it expects FCF to be in “positive territory” in 2020, with further acceleration in 2021.

For the latest quarter, industrial FCF was $650 million, down from $1.14 billion. Analyst Andrew Obin at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said FCF was “surprisingly strong” as he was expecting “flat.” He reiterated his neutral rating, saying he views the underlying drivers of FCF as “relatively low quality” and with “limited disclosure.’

GE reported earlier a third-quarter net loss of $9.47 billion, or $1.08 a share, after a loss of $22.81 billion, or $2.64 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as an $8.7 billion charge from ceding majority ownership of Baker Hughes and other insurance-related and goodwill charges, adjusted earnings per share rose to 15 cents from 11 cents, to beat the FactSet consensus of 12 cents.

That marks the third-straight quarter that GE beat adjusted profit expectations.

Total revenue increased 1% to $23.48 billion, with a 14% drop in revenue in its power business was offset by a 13 increase in renewable energy, 8% growth in aviation and a 5% rise in healthcare. Read more about GE’s business segment performance.

Within the power division, orders fell 30%, while the 14% revenue decline came as gas power revenue rose 2% and power portfolio revenue slumped 37%, largely driven by weakness in the steam business.

The revenue decline was an improvement from the 25% drop in the sequential second quarter and a 22% decline in the first quarter. It was the smallest revenue decline for power since the 9% fall in the first quarter of 2018.

The revenue growth came with a 2.9% decrease in the cost of sales to $17.33 billion. Outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on the call that part of the decline in gross corporate costs came with job cuts, which reached about 7,000 so far this year.

For the rest of the year, CEO Culp said the “watch items” are the same, including an uncertain global economy, trade and tariffs, the continued grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 MAX planes for which GE makes the engines, and the low interest rate environment.

“So in summary, the hard work continues,” Culp said. “And from the inside, I’m seeing the improvements I wanted to see when we started on this path a year ago, improvements that will yield long-term results for all of GE’s stakeholders.”

Perhaps next quarter, Culp can stop using the “reset” word to describe the company’s progress."
14,11/05/2019,ge,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/31/ge-stock-soars-11-as-the-turnaround-gains-momentum.aspx,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock has experienced extreme volatility over the past year, as investors have struggled to understand the company's chances of turning itself around. On one hand, new CEO Larry Culp has provided a steady hand and motivated his subordinates to deliver better execution. On the other hand, many parts of GE's power and renewables segments are struggling, the company continues to carry a heavy debt load, and some investors are worried about the potential for significant additional losses at GE Capital.

In recent months, the bears have been winning the debate, as GE stock has slipped far below its 52-week high of around $11. However, General Electric made solid progress on its turnaround last quarter. This caused the stock to jump 11% on Wednesday, surpassing the $10 mark for the first time in nearly three months. Even after this big gain, GE stock has plenty of upside, as long as the company doesn't face any major setbacks in 2020.

GE reports solid Q3 results and boosts cash flow guidance

As usual, there were a lot of moving parts in General Electric's earnings report last quarter, because the company is in the midst of a major restructuring. Revenue was roughly flat year over year at $23.4 billion. Revenue for the company's industrial businesses rose 7% on an organic basis, though. Meanwhile, GE posted a loss from continuing operations of $0.15 per share but an adjusted profit of $0.15 per share. That beat the average analyst estimate of $0.11.

The $0.30 difference between earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted EPS was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge, an insurance charge related to lower interest rates, and other smaller one-time items.

GE's adjusted industrial operating margin improved to 10% from 8.5% a year earlier, because of big charges recorded by the struggling power segment in Q3 2018. (GE Power reduced its operating loss by 79% year over year.) The highly profitable aviation and health segments also posted modest earnings growth last quarter, but the renewables business swung to a small loss from a small profit in the prior-year period.

For the full year, General Electric is maintaining its guidance for adjusted EPS to come in between $0.55 and $0.65, despite a $0.05 headwind from giving up its majority stake in Baker Hughes in September. In addition, for the second straight quarter, GE raised its full-year free cash flow guidance by $1 billion. It now expects to produce $0 to $2 billion of industrial free cash flow in 2019.

Another eventful quarter

There was a lot of news at GE last quarter. In August, serial whistleblower Harry Markopolos accused it of accounting fraud, particularly with respect to its insurance business. GE stock plunged by 11% immediately following the accusations, but experts quickly dismissed Markopolos' analysis. Indeed, on Wednesday, GE reported that the company's annual test of its insurance reserves found that the new actuarial assumptions it adopted two years ago remain valid. While the company took a $1 billion pre-tax charge related to its insurance business, that was driven by changes to the discount rate used to estimate future investment returns.

GE also continued to address its weak balance sheet during the third quarter. Most notably, it sold the rest of its shares in Wabtec and sold another substantial portion of its stake in Baker Hughes. This enabled it to reduce its gross borrowings to $93.2 billion as of the end of last quarter, down from $105.8 billion a quarter earlier.

Finally, General Electric announced several changes to its pension and other retirement programs in early October. Most notably, it will freeze the pension benefits of 20,000 current salaried employees at the end of 2020. Those employees will keep the benefits they have already earned but will receive 401(k) plan contributions rather than accruing additional pension benefits in the future. This move and several other adjustments will largely offset the impact of this year's decline in interest rates, which would have caused GE's pension deficit to spike higher.

Plenty of room for improvement

General Electric has made a lot of progress in fixing its problems over the past year. It has also lined up several major asset sales, which will enable it to significantly reduce its debt again in 2020, reducing the inherent risk of GE stock.

Nevertheless, Culp and his leadership team recognize that the company still has a lot of work ahead of it. While Culp expects results to improve next year, GE will still be working through restructuring costs and various legacy issues. It will take until at least 2021 for GE to really hit its stride.

However, if GE can get its weaker business units back to sustainable profitability by then (or soon thereafter), it would be great news for shareholders. The company's largest and most profitable business, GE Aviation, has ample room for revenue and profit growth in the years ahead, driven by a growing military business and rising services revenue from its expanding installed base of commercial jet engines. Without the rest of the company holding it back, the aviation segment's strong growth should drive big gains for GE stock."

General Electric increased industrial product and service sales 1 percent in the third quarter, but overall revenue was pulled down by its GE Capital division in Norwalk which the conglomerate continues to shrink one year into the tenure of CEO Larry Culp Jr.

GE recorded a $9.5 billion loss for the quarter, most of it to account for GE ceding ownership of the oil field services company Baker Hughes which GE acquired in 2017 a year after former CEO Jeff Immelt moved GE’s headquarters to Boston from Fairfield.

GE also took an $800 million charge against earnings for a former insurance unit that remains on the hook for claims on policies from years ago.

On a Wednesday conference call, Culp to investment analysts that GE has been able to contain some expected severance costs for job terminations as employees have left on their own accord.

Revenue totaled $23.36 billion in the third quarter, down $32 million from a year ago, with orders on which GE expects to record fuure revenue off 5 percent to $22.5 billion. GE’s total backlog of orders remains up 14 percent from a year ago, however, to $368 billion. Shares of GE crested the $10 mark Wednesday morning before tailing off slightly in the afternoon, up nearly 10 percent from the closing price Tuesday.

GE told investors on Wednesday that China tariffs are having an ongoing impact on profits, particularly for divisions selling medical equipment and renewable energy systems. And the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets continues to affect GE Aviation results, with the company part of a joint venture supplying engines for the aircraft and currently expecting a $1.4 billion impact to GE Aviation.

“Obviously, we didn’t come into this year expecting what has played out in that regard,” Culp said Wednesday. “Again, our primary focus is to support Boeing and our carrier customers with respect to what they return to service.”

Culp is continuing Immelt’s plan to reduce GE Capital to providing financing to support the parent company’s industrial units, versus the broad array of commercial and consumer financial services GE Capital oversaw formerly. The company shed GE Capital assets totaling roughly $2 billion during the quarter to leave it with $121 billion in assets entering October, with GE Capital revenue down 15 percent in the third quarter to $2.1 billion.

GE Capital took a $663 million loss in the third quarter after recording a small profit in the same period a year ago, with GE running an annual “premium deficiency” test on insurance reserves it keeps on the books in accordance with U.S. accounting rules.

GE Capital’s losses for the first nine months of the year are $344 million, an improvement from the $2 billion in red ink it produced in the first three quarters of 2018.

General Electric Co.’s path to recovery is a long one, but the company no longer seems lost in the woods.

In releasing its third-quarter results on Wednesday, GE also raised its guidance for 2019 free cash flow and now anticipates its industrial businesses could bring in as much as $2 billion this year. That’s a $4 billion swing from GE’s worst-case scenario in its initial March forecast. There’s a fine line between setting a low bar and sandbagging the numbers, but GE’s rosier outlook is supported by signs of stabilization in its beleaguered power unit and there being less of a drag than anticipated from the transition of a supply-chain financing program to a third party. The aviation business was also able to largely offset the negative impact of the continued grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max. Those were key worry points that ended up not being as worrisome.

It wasn’t a perfect quarter and there are some notable footnotes to that guidance increase. Still, a lack of nasty surprises and minimal signs to date of macroeconomic weakness in GE’s aviation and health-care businesses make this a victory for CEO Larry Culp. A flurry of deleveraging activities in the last two months had raised concerns that GE was trying to give itself some good news to talk about if the actual quarterly numbers were disappointments, particularly amid growing concerns that a manufacturing slowdown was deepening. That fear appears unfounded, at least as far as the last three months are concerned for GE’s businesses.

Staging a Recovery GE shares had slumped since its last earnings update amid concerns about interest rates and accusations from a short-seller-backed whistle-blower Source: Bloomberg

Shares of GE rallied as much as 14% on the report, essentially erasing a slide since its last earnings update in July that in part reflected concerns over the impact of slumping interest rates. The decline in rates forced GE to reassess its expectations for the returns it will get on assets supporting the company’s long-term-care insurance business. While this contributed to a $1 billion pre-tax charge in the latest quarter as the company bolstered its GAAP reserves, it’s better than the “ somewhere south” of $1.5 billion adjustment – before other offsets – that Culp had flagged in September. And it’s certainly nowhere in the ballpark of what’s implied in the $29 billion reserve shortfall Bernie Madoff whistle-blower Harry Markopolos claimed existed.

Operating profit for the power segment turned negative again after a few quarters of positive numbers. But margins did improve in that business – to negative 3.7% from negative 14.8% a year earlier – which GE says reflects better pricing discipline. The company now expects the cash burn at the power unit to be no worse than the $2.3 billion outflow last year (adjusted for a reorganization of that business), versus an initial prediction of a substantial year-over-year weakening. The health-care division saw a nice lift in profit margins and a 5% jump in sales, even as its imaging business struggled in China and some larger U.S> projects got pushed out. And aviation rebounded from an uncharacteristically weak second quarter. These are all positive data points that speak to Culp’s push for operational improvements.

What hasn’t changed is that even at $2 billion, GE’s free cash flow will be very weak this year. The current forecast compares to $4.5 billion last year and $5.6 billion in 2017. While a stronger starting point in 2019 certainly helps, GE will have to overcome a number of challenges to get back to even those depressed levels.

Still Resetting GE's free cash flow is likely to remain at historically depressed levels over the next few years Source: Bloomberg

Already, GE will lose about $1 billion in free cash flow in 2020 from the sale of its biopharmaceutical business to Danaher Corp., per analysts’ estimates. Despite an improved performance in 2019, there’s no update at this time for GE’s expectation for the power unit to continue burning cash next year. And GE has to keep spending on restructuring. It again lowered its estimate for the cost of these cutbacks this year (which was a boon to its free-cash-flow outlook) in part because of the “timing” of politically fraught conversations in Europe over facilities and employees absorbed as part of its disastrous acquisition of Alstom SA’s power business. Keeping economic headwinds at bay will also be key.

Meanwhile, GE will get lower contributions from Baker Hughes as it continues to wind down its stake; a divestiture in September pushed that holding below 50%, forcing the company to take an $8.7 billion pre-tax charge in the quarter.

Culp is doing what he needs to do to stop the bleeding at GE. Now the conversation shifts to what kind of company this is going to look like when he’s done and how far this turnaround can go.

Clariscan is a gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial), spine and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.

Clariscan has been approved in more than 55 countries globally and has had more than four million patient doses shipped in those countries. It is the latest in a growing range of imaging agents available in the U.S. from GE Healthcare. For more than 40 years, GE agents have been routinely used across MRI, X-ray/CT and ultrasound to enhance the image and support diagnosis.

“ Demand for contrast media has significantly increased over the past decade. The introduction of Clariscan increases our clinical offering for U.S. radiologists, enhancing visualization to provide better patient care. Our customers rely on our high-quality products, first-rate supply network, and surrounding services to support their day-to-day work,” explained Kevin O’Neill, President & CEO Pharmaceutical Diagnostics at GE Healthcare.

“ The FDA’s approval of this macrocyclic MR agent adds to the range of contrast media options available here in the U.S. and as radiologists we welcome this broader choice,” said Dr. Lawrence N Tanenbaum, M.D., FACR.

GE Healthcare offers diagnostic imaging agents used in approximately 90 million procedures per year globally, equivalent to three patients every second. In the U.S., GE Healthcare has a strong record of innovation in new contrast media products and indications, with recent FDA approvals for Omnipaque™ (iohexol) in CT of the abdomen and for Visipaque™ (iodixanol) in coronary CT angiography. GE Healthcare has invested $240 million in its global manufacturing and supply network over the past five years to deliver imaging agents to hospitals and pharmacies globally.

Clariscan is manufactured in Norway using a proprietary manufacturing process. As with all GE Healthcare contrast media products, all stages of manufacturing, from development of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to finished product, are managed entirely by GE Healthcare. Clariscan is available in single dose vials of 10, 15 and 20 mL. The packaging contains a 2D data matrix (barcode) on every Clariscan pack, which conveys key information, including national drug code number, individual lot number, and expiration date. This information can be easily scanned and uploaded onto electronic medical systems, helping to reduce the risk of manual data entry errors and helping workflow efficiencies at medical centers.

CLARISCANTM (gadoterate meglumine) injection for intravenous use

PRODUCT INDICATIONS AND USE:

CLARISCAN™ (gadoterate meglumine) is a gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial), spine, and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.

Additional pediatric use information is approved for Guerbet LLC’s Dotarem (gadoterate meglumine injection). However, due to Guerbet LLC’s marketing exclusivity, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT CLARISCANTM

WARNING: NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS (NSF)

See full Prescribing Information for complete Boxed Warning. Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with: Chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), or Acute kidney injury.

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g. age > 60 years, hypertension, diabetes), estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.

For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Clariscan dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to any re-administration.

Contraindications

History of clinically important hypersensitivity reactions to Clariscan.

Warnings and precautions

Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with Clariscan, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of Clariscan administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before Clariscan administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Clariscan. Administer Clariscan only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation.

Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with Clariscan, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of Clariscan administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Gadolinium retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. The highest concentrations have been identified in the bone, followed by brain, skin, kidney, liver and spleen. The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention.

The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Acute kidney injury : In patients with chronically reduced renal function, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging.

: In patients with chronically reduced renal function, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging. Extravasation and injection site reactions: Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of Clariscan. Extravasation into tissues during Clariscan administration may result in tissue irritation.

Adverse reactions

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 0.2%) associated with Clariscan in clinical trials were nausea, headache, injection site pain, injection site coldness and rash.

Serious adverse reactions in the postmarketing experience have been reported with Clariscan. These serious adverse reactions include but are not limited to: arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, pharyngeal edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, coma and convulsion.

Use in specific populations

Pregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. The human data on the association between GBCAs and adverse fetal outcomes are limited and inconclusive. Because of the potential risks of gadolinium to the fetus, use Clariscan only if imaging is essential during pregnancy and cannot be delayed. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal exposure to GBCAs.
